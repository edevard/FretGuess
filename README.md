# FretGuess

FretGuess is a Python TKinter app to learn the notes on guitar frets.

**Planned features**

- Setup general interface for FretGuess (sidebar, main content, possible timer area)
- Include timer option (field + possible slider)
- Include "start practicing button"
- Include row-based "guess fret", "what string", and "reveal answer" part, per row
- Run timer on "start practicing" button press
- Sliding rows when next note needs to be guessed (reveal answer func -> next fret -> old row slides one row down, with max 5-10 rows?)
- Include automatic next fret guess (timer for guessing the fret, with new timer for "next fret")
- Include interactivity (Press space for reveal answer? and space again for next random fret?)
